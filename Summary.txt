Give your answer after each question and before the dashed lines, which you
should not remove. Your answers can be multiple lines. THANK YOU!

DID YOU SUCCESSFULLY IMPLEMENT EVERYTHING THAT WAS REQUESTED? Either answer
"Yes" or describe what you were and were not able to implement. [1 point]

yes

----------------------------------------

DOES EVERYTHING WORK TO THE BEST OF YOUR KNOWLEDGE, AND DO ALL TESTS PASS?
If the answer is not "Yes", please state here which parts did not work and
which tests did not pass. [1 point]

yes

WHAT WAS THE TOTAL AMOUNT OF TIME YOU SPENT ON THE ASSIGNMENT? Rather than
giving a range, if you are unsure, give the average of the range. Use hours.
[1 point]
10 hours

----------------------------------------

WHO DID YOU WORK WITH AND HOW? Discussing the assignment with people not on
your team is fine as long as you don't share code. [1 point]
We worked with TA Anish, Danny, and William.
Anish helped with explaining how to make the panagram blue by using a for loop.
Danny helped with explaining string concatenation and helped us with understanding
string.format more. He also reminded us to make sure everything was either all lowercase
or uppercase to prevent any problems.

GIVE ONE OR MORE PARAGRAPHS REFLECTING ON YOUR EXPERIENCE WITH THE
ASSIGNMENT, including answers to **all** of these questions:

* How hard did you find decomposition (determining what helper methods to create?
* What was the most difficult part of the assignment?
* What was the most rewarding part of the assignment?
* Did you create tests? Do you think your choice saved or cost you time?
* What did you learn doing the assignment?

Constructive and actionable suggestions for improving assignments, office hours, and
lecture are always welcome. If there was a TA or classmate who was especially helpful,
say so.

If you implemented additional milestones, please say so. [6 points]

Decomposition was pretty hard because, at first, we didn't really know what actions we wanted to
put into each. However, as we got the hang of it later, we were able to delegate the right
tasks to each helper method and better organize our code. The most difficult part of the assignment for us
was making sure everything was either uppercase or lowercase. We had trouble with that until Danny pointed out to us
that our dictionary was all lowercase, however, we were making our letters in our hash set, uppercase. Checkstyle also
kept saying that the number 7 and 4 were magic numbers so we had to change some things.
The most rewarding part of the project was taking a game that we all play and making our own version out of our code.
I thought that was really cool to see that we could make our own nyt spelling bee. We did not create tests,
I think it might have saved us time because we could directly see if it worked or not when we ran the program.
What we learned from doing this assignment was sort of the basics of making a website or game. Such as the buttons
and what they do during the game. It also gave us practice on creating good helper methods. Peer TA Danny was
especially helpful!!

We implemented Optional Milestone, Shuffle.
